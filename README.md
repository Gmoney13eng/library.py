This assignment involves creating a Python library to perform various string manipulations, similar to some built-in string methods, but without directly using them. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the requirements, along with what each function is supposed to do and how they could be implemented.

The is_alpha function examines whether all characters in a given string are alphabetic (either uppercase or lowercase letters). This function should loop through each character in the input string, verifying that each one appears in either the ASCII_LOWERCASE or ASCII_UPPERCASE constant. If every character meets this criterion, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

# is_alpha(str) -> bool

# is_digit(str) -> bool

# to_lower(str) -> str

# to_upper(str) -> str

# find_chr(str, str) -> int
